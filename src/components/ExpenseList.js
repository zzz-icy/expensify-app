// [mapStateToProps(state, [ownProps]): stateProps] (Function):  If this argument is specified, the new component will subscribe to Redux store updates. This means that any time the store is updated, mapStateToProps will be called. The results of mapStateToProps must be a plain object, which will be merged into the componentâ€™s props. If you don't want to subscribe to store updates, pass null or undefined in place of mapStateToProps.

// because connect() returns a function, not directly a HOC
// It does not modify the component class passed to it; instead, it returns a new, connected component class for you to use.
