// ou can create partial Sass files that contain little snippets of CSS that you can include in other Sass files. This is a great way to modularize your CSS and help keep things easier to maintain. A partial is simply a Sass file named with a leading underscore. You might name it something like _partial.scss. The underscore lets Sass know that the file is only a partial file and that it should not be generated into a CSS file. Sass partials are used with the @import directive.

// The CSS box-sizing property allows us to include the padding and border in an element's total width and height.

// By default, the width and height of an element is calculated like this:

// width + padding + border = actual width of an element
// height + padding + border = actual height of an element

// This means: When you set the width/height of an element, the element often appear bigger than you have set (because the element's border and padding are added to the element's specified width/height).
// If you set box-sizing: border-box; on an element padding and border are included in the width and height:


* {
    // content-box default
    box-sizing:border-box;
}

html {
    font-size: 62.5%; // 16*0.625=10, so now 1rem = 10px
}

body{
    color:$dark-grey;
    // background: $dark-blue;
    font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;  // golobal font family
    font-size: $m-size; // 16px
    line-height:1.6;
}

button {
    cursor: pointer;

}

button:disabled{  //The :disabled selector matches every disabled element
    cursor: default;
}

.is-active { 
font-weight: bold;
